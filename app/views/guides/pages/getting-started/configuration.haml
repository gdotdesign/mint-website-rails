%p
  Your application / package is configured with the
  %code mint.json
  file (which is a
  %a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON")
    JSON
  file).

%p
  An example
  %code mint.json
  file of looks like this:

%pre
  %code.json
    :plain
      {
        "name": "my-app",
        "source-directories": [
          "source"
        ],
        "dependencies": {
          "mint-codemirror": {
            "repository": "https://github.com/mint-lang/mint-codemirror",
            "constraint": "5.0.0 <= v < 6.0.0"
          }
        }
      }

%h2 Dependencies

%p
  The dependencies array contains all the packages that your application needs.

%p
  Each is an object that has a:

%ul
  %li
    %code repository
    field pointing to Git repository which uniquely identifies it

  %li
    %code constraint
    field that is the version information in one of two formats:

    %ul
      %li
        %code 0.0.0 <= v < 1.0.0
        where the
        %code v
        is the resolvable version

      %li
        %code master:1.0.0
        where the first part is the Git reference (of a branch, commit hash or tag)
        followed by a colon and the version the package should resolve as this is
        necessary because the version is only specified by tags.
